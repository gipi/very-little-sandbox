This is a simple experiment about using library interposition
by the LD_PRELOAD trick.

Simply the library is going to intercept some libc calls and
make stuffs.

In order to use this you can launch your application in this way

 $ LD_PRELOAD=./libwrap.so cat /etc/password >/dev/null
 [opened file: '/etc/passwd']
 $ LD_PRELOAD=./libwrap.so ncat google 80
 [opened file: '/etc/hosts']
 [connect to 208.67.222.222:53]
 [opened file: '/dev/urandom']
 [opened file: '/dev/urandom']
 [connect to 67.215.65.132:80]
